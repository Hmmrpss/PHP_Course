PHP Basic Syntax - Lab
This document defines a set of tasks to be done as a part of the PHP Basic Syntax lecture’s exercises.
 
1.	Calculate Two Numbers
Calculate the sum or the differance of two numbers.

2.	Find Largest of Three Numbers
You are given three numbers. Print out the largest number.
 
3.	Find Largest from Undefined Count of Numbers
You need to read numbers from the standard input until receiving empty string and find the maximum number amongst them. Print out the largest one.

4.	Largest Number Again
Having in mind the considerations in Task 3, find the largest number, but this time the input numbers might contain negatives. 

5.	Count Letters
You will receive a single line containing a word (or at least a set or characters). You need to print out how many times each letter is found in order of the letter appearance.

6.	Count Letters – Sorted
As in Task 5, but the output should be sorted by the times a letter has occurred in descending order, then in order of appearance.

7. Render Students Info
You are given an HTML form that contains three input fields. The first one is a dropdown containing delimiters (“,”, “|”, “&”). The second one containing student names separated by the selected delimiter. The third one – student ages separated by the selected delimiter. You need to output an HTML table with headers “Name” and “Age” and each student as a row in a table.
	1.	Separate the HTML and the PHP
	2.	Split the input from Names and Ages by the selected delimiter
	3.	Render a table only if names and ages arrays are initialized
	4.	Use foreach/endforeach or for/endfor to introduce new table rows
Render the HTML table only with these students are at least 18 years old.
