PHP Basic Syntax - Lab
This document defines a set of tasks to be done as a part of the PHP Basic Syntax lecture’s exercises.
 
1.	Calculate Two Numbers
Calculate the sum or the differance of two numbers.

2.	Find Largest of Three Numbers
You are given three numbers. Print out the largest number.
 
3.	Find Largest from Undefined Count of Numbers
You need to read numbers from the standard input until receiving empty string and find the maximum number amongst them. Print out the largest one.

4.	Largest Number Again
Having in mind the considerations in Task 3, find the largest number, but this time the input numbers might contain negatives. 

5.	Count Letters
You will receive a single line containing a word (or at least a set or characters). You need to print out how many times each letter is found in order of the letter appearance.

6.	Count Letters – Sorted
As in Task 5, but the output should be sorted by the times a letter has occurred in descending order, then in order of appearance.
